# Polymorphism Practice #1
# The built-in function in Python len() has a polymorphic behavior, since it calculates the length of an object based on its type (strings, lists, tuples, among others), returning the number of items or characters that make it.

# Create an iterator that iterates through the following objects: word, list, tuple and displays on the screen (using print()) for each of them its length with the len() function.





# Polymorphism Practice #2
# You have three classes of characters in a game, which have their specific attack methods.
  
# Create an iterator that performs a conjugate attack in the following order: Archer, Wizard, Samurai, by calling each character's attack() method. You'll need to instantiate each of the above classes to build an iterable (a list called characters) that can be iterated through in that order.




# Polymorphism Practice #3
# You have three character classes in a game, all of which have their specific defense methods.

# Create a function called general_defense(), which can receive an object (an instance of your character classes), and execute its defend() method regardless of what type of character it is.
