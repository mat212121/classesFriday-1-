# Extended Inheritance Practice #2
# "The platypus is one of the rarest creatures in the world: although it is a mammal, it lays eggs; and it nurses its young but has no nipples." (National Geographic)

# Create a Platypus class that inherits from other classes: Vertebrate, Fish, Reptile, Bird, and Mammal, so that you "build" an animal that has the following methods and attributes:

# - lay_eggs()

# - has_peak = True

# - vertebrate = True

# - poisonous = True

# - swim()

# - walk()

# - nurse()





# Extended Inheritance Practice #3
# A son has inherited all his characteristics from his father, however, they have different hobbies. Make the Child class inherit all its methods and attributes from Father, overriding the hobby() method so that it returns [1]: "I play video games in my free time"



# [1]: make sure to use return statement instead of print()
